# hello-world
My first repository. A discovery of Github.

For these last years I have been a student that wanted to make the best version of himself, not caring much about what other did. And although I achieve my goals of self-impovement, there was something missing in my education: teamwork. Project after project failed. Therefore I am now a student that looks for ways on how to create a team.
